Apache Airflow: Orchestrating a Data Pipeline

In this first data engineering project, I learned how to extract weather data using an API;
I understood what Apache Airflow is and how to use it;
I discovered what DAGs, Taks and Operators are;
I also got to know the main components of the Airflow architecture, in addition to knowing what are the main interface resources to develop my first DAG.
